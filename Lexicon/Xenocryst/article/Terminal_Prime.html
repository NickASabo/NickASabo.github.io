<h1>Terminal Prime</h1>
<p>Terminal Prime is what appears to be the central control terminal for the <a href="Ellow_Cable.html">Ellow Cable</a> network on Skaoi IV. It was discovered on the western side of <a href="The_Giant_Dividing_Wall.html">The Giant Dividing Wall</a> in the middle of the ruins of a technologically advanced city by an exploratory crew sent from the Ogden on orders from the captain. The building containing the terminal was the only building found largely intact in the entire city. It is believed that the building's high <a href="Titanite.html">Titanite</a> content and Titanite's self-repairing properties are likely responsible for this. Unfortunately, the building also retained power (likely from a nuclear source) and automated defense capabilities, and the team took heavy casualties breaking in.</p>
<p>The information gained from Terminal Prime soon proved invaluable in fetching and decoding data from the rest of the 
Ellow Cable 
network. The networking protocols and standards revealed allowed us to connect to the network without frying our devices or causing them to be overwritten, as in early attempts. More importantly to my team, Terminal Prime allowed us to deactivate the defenses of the building and avoid further casualties.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more important to preventing future casualties was the revelation of more information regarding the black hole at the center of the planet. In particular, that it could not truly be a black hole, given that sometimes certain... <a href="Voidsenders.html">things</a>... came out of it (the records even in the backup that described the things in any fashion showed signs of tampering as to the nature of these entities). Moreover, these entities appeared to be the harbinger of some kind of semi-periodic event leading to the destruction of all sentient life on Skaoi IV. It was unclear whether the entities or the "black hole" itself were the cause of these events. Again, all explicit records were obviously modified to obscure the truth.</p>
