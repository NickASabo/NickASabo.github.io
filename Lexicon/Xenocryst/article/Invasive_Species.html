<h1>Invasive Species</h1>
<p><b>General Overview</b><br>
An <b>invasive species</b> is a non-native organism which disrupts an ecosystem. This disruption, generally threatening the 
extinction of a native organism, may be habitat loss, competition for an essential resource, predation, pollution, or radiation poisoning. 
Such organisms may be particularly problematic as the carrier of harmful parasites or when they lack a natural predator in the region.</p>
<p><b>History</b><br>
Originally defined by ancient scholastics to describe the intercontinental, human-transported spread of macro-organisms, this definition
was broadened in the middle 3000's by, again, the now-defunct Fantastical College of Mars to include interplanetary spread and 
micro-organisms. As the spread of micro-organisms is nigh-inevitable, people stopped caring by the late-middle 3000's.</p>
<p><b>Modern Environmentalism</b><br>
As the Federated Republic of Planets spread beyond their local sector into planets not terraformed, but blessed with life of their
own, the topic of invasive species re-entered the public consciousness. As such, strict embargos are in effect. 
Ecologists are required on every exploratory mission to identify keystone species, classify niches, and collect reconstructable samples, and 
crewmen and mimes must obtain all necessary materials from the host planet.</p>
<p><b>Invasive Species in Unnatural Environments</b><br>
Ecologists recently introduced the idea of invasive species in sentient-created environs, such as spaceships or nurseries. For 
instance, on the Ashbery, after the first expedition to Skaoi IV, an astrobiologist brought on board six (6) specimens of Ghallas Ratbird, which began displacing the local populace of Felis Postneodomesticus owned by the esteemed Director of Travels and 
Communication. The Ratbirds:<br>
(1) Filled the cat's litterboxes, and the rest of the ship, with <a href="Ghallas_Scat-droppings.html">guano</a>, overtaking and polluting the cat's habitat,<br>
(2) Introduced a secondary invasive species of flea,<br>
(3) Stole the cat's Fatty-Cockroach Delight, their favorite.</p>
<p>Such specimens were released by <a href="Scatmanism.html">raving lunatics converted during the visit to Skaoi IV</a>, now properly quarantined. Nonetheless, unless this infestation is dealt with quickly, a certain astrobiologist will have hell to pay.</p>

<p>Memo (Do not put this in the article, Keith, type them up separately):</p>
<p>Lieutenant Redshirt, please report to the Carroll with <a href="6c679d25.html">Maverick</a> (Keith: Check if that's the right ship.) at next rotation to aid in the extraction of Tyne, Esq., and the rest of the mimes. Dr. Wyndenhart, you are to remain on the ship until this infestation is dealt with.</p>
