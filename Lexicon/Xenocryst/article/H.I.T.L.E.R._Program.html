<h1>H.I.T.L.E.R. Program</h1>
<p>The H.I.T.L.E.R. Program is an acronym for the Humanoid Intern Training Leadership Education Relocation Program. The program is designed to allow new dreamers and doers to accelerate their careers in their chosen profession. The H.I.T.L.E.R Program also allows new <a href="Confederated_Democracy_of_Systems_Royal_University.html">Confederated Democracy of Systems Royal University</a> graduates to gather the needed tools and resources they will need to succeed as a future leader of the intern's chosen career track. The program offers the following:</p>
<p>1. On the job training in the intern's chosen field of study</p>
<p>2. Milestones to measures the intern's success during the program</p>
<p>3. Career readiness training and coaching from industry mentors</p>
<p>4. Professional network and personal brand development</p>
<p>5. Travel to exotic locations throughout the galaxy</p>
<p>The current recruitment for the H.I.T.L.E.R Program is for the exploration of <a href="Skaoi_IV.html">Skaoi IV</a>. The Program was revitalized after <a href="The_Discovery_of_Skaoi_IV.html">The Discovery of Skaoi IV</a>. The Federated Republic of Planets relies on the Program to keep unemployment low and job place high. Alumni of the H.I.T.L.E.R Program are recognized throughout the galaxy as the highly skilled and trained individuals. The Carroll and Ogden research teams are mostly composed of H.I.T.L.E.R. Program participants. One of the program's recent successes is the discovery of <a href="Titanite.html">Titanite</a> on Skaoi IV by Carroll research team.</p>
<p>On a side note, the program bears the unfortunate name identical to the worst slaughter of the 20th century, Adolf Hitler. This Hitler was the leader of the Nazi political party and caused a genocide that killed more than six million Terrans. After 2000 years, his crimes were mostly forgotten to the past and the name has lost its dark connotation. </p>
