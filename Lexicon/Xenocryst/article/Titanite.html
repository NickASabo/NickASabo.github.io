<h1>Titanite</h1>
<p>I'll be frank: We're in a bit of a pickle, Director Khan. We were providing background music for the researchers documenting <a href="Zyther_Temple.html">the temple to Zyther</a> as usual, when an expedition member <a href="Mirthful_and_Monstrous_Spiderbeings.html">who shall remain unnamed</a> asked the Wordless Portable Orchestra Corps to take advantage of the acoustics in a large pit beneath the center of the temple. We were so eager to test out the echo factor, we completely failed to notice that the pit had no bottom. I have submitted a formal complaint about this to the HR Department, as inducement to jump down holes falls under section 12f.</p>
<p>We would have fallen straight into the black hole in the hollow center of the planet if we hadn't recently incorporated the local <b>titanite</b> into our instruments. By using the material's curious anti-gravity properties, we were able to avoid the event horizon and have since fallen into a loose elliptical orbit around it. Felicitously, the view from our orbit gave us a unique opportunity to observe the ecology of the inside of Skaoi IV. Our observations suggest that the <a href="Interior_Arachnowyrms.html">enormous spiderdragons</a> that head the food chain of the interior have titanite worked into their teeth and nails (and probably their skeletons). Additionally, the various inner-planet orbital biomes all seem to have large deposits of titanite embedded in them, which is likely how they avoid falling into the stygian maw below.</p>
<p>Speaking of those, our orbit takes us close to <a href="Yttrois.html">Yttrois</a> every so often, so if you could have Dr. Wyndenhart bring some rope next time she comes by for <a href="Ghallas_Scat-droppings.html">her research</a>, that would be excellent. We avoided the acid rain that falls off the inner surface by being in Yttrois's shadow last time, but we might not be so lucky in the future. Also, we're running low on food, and may have to eat the percussion section if you don't act soon.</p>
