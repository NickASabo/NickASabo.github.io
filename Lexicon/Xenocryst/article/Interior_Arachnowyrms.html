<h1>Interior Arachnowyrms</h1>
<p><i>Aranaco dominus</i> (common name <b>interior arachnowyrm</b>) is an elegant species which lives in <a href="Downtown_Skaoi.html">Downtown Skaoi</a>, the interior of Skaoi IV, although they occasionally venture onto the surface for <a href="Ratbird_hunting.html">recreational purposes</a>. In fact, that is how I came into contact with one of them when I unfortunately became separated from the rest of the landing party. I provide an abridged transcript of the encounter:</p>
<p>Arachnowyrm: Goodness gracious me, are you quite alright?<br>
Me: Yes, am quite okay, yes. Wow, who you are?<br>
A: I am Jefferson. Pleased to make your acquaintance.<br>
M: Ah, yes, greets, I am be Q''ins'mat'.<br>
A: Where do you come from, Q''ins'mat'?<br>
M: Am come from planet...<br>
<i>Introductions carried on for a time, and Jefferson invited me to high tea in Downtown Skaoi. I delightedly accepted.</i> <br>
A: So you are an anthropologist of sorts?<br>
M: Is only hobby. I have been study anthropology at CDS Royal University, but have became ambassador after.<br>
A: Jolly good. I have done some basic anthropological research myself. I have learned much about the <a href="Jekalomora.html">Jekalomora</a> and <a href="Mirthful_and_Monstrous_Spiderbeings.html">seminobis</a> dwelling on the surface. Their cultures are not very advanced, I must admit, but it is good to learn about foreign practices. It lends a bit of perspective.</p>
<p>Eventually I realized that this species was mostly hogwash softies, and I took my leave. I did learn, however, that despite their soft personalities, their physical features would put a spiderbeing to shame. Their hide and teeth are incredibly tough, and they seem to be able to fly even with their laughably small wings. Creature to be reckoned with. Little wonder west of the <a href="Cytorius_Gate.html">Cytorius Gate</a> is completely ruined.</p>
