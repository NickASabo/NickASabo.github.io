<h1>The Discovery of Skaoi IV</h1>
<p>No, dumb computer, speech-to-text on, oh, good.</p>
<p>Skaoi IV was discovered in the early 3000's by researchers at the now-defunct Imaginary Martian University. Who cares. Dell eat last line. It came of interest, however, in 4787, during the FRP's Travel Division's Goldilocks Survey. Because Skaoi was located on a border of the map's subdivision between The Palatial Institute and The Twelfth University of Terra, both are credited with the discovery of intelligent life upon its surface. As such, special naming rights are still a matter of negotiation between these two prestigious institutions. Both institutions have sponsored separate research missions, aided by the FRP's Travel Division.</p>
<p>Although the announcements of suspicions of alien life were nigh-simultaneous, the methods of discovery were wildly different. The Twelfth University of Terra's method, while straightforward, was a technical marvel of laser-mapping observation. Using an array of demilitarized, precision class 4,514,349.43, upsilon-radiation lasers, they mapped the topography, first noting enormous cubes, high atop the <a href="Golgian_Mountain_Range.html">Golgian Mountain Range</a>, and a closer examination revealed the cities. The Palatial Institute used a new array of free-floating <a href="Wiegler-Nrtan_Vibration.html">Wiegler-Nrtan Vibration</a> sensors to search for frequencies of interest in their Goldilocks Survey Sector. Described initially as an "arpeggio" by Profesor Rojo, the frequency immediately attracted attention and was soon triangulated to Skaoi IV.</p>
<p>The Federated Republic of Planets is proud to announce the immediate annexation of Skaoi IV. As the scientific hotbed responsible for this fine planet's discovery, we will offer exclusive access to all technological and natural resources therein for FRP departments and affiliated academies.</p>

<p>Speech to Test Off</p>
<p>Ma'am, the voyages will be arriving soon.</p>
<p>Ugh, right. Water down some chardonnay, tell them it's champagne or something.</p>
<p>Shall I give them the tour?</p>
<p>Whatever, yeah. Give them second level spa access no third they don't need second. I want the genetic refresher open. This missed.</p>
