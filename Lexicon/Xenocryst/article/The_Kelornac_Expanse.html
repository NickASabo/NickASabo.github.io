<h1>The Kelornac Expanse</h1>
<p>The Kelornac Expanse is a vast plain occupying the eastern half of the continent of <a href="Skaoi_IV.html">Kelorna</a> (named after the Captain's favorite fictional character), and was the initial landing site of the Ogden's first scouting crew. Orbital surveillance found five primary ruins sites (designated A, B, C, D, and E) scattered about the plain, all near large canyons.</p>
<p>Initial exploration took place 20 klicks outside of the perimeter of <a href="Site_D.html">Site D</a>, in the area now designated Subsite 1 where orbital surveillance indicated the presence of a few buildings, possibly a satellite settlement. Initial exploration was performed with full biohazard suit with built-in full life-support, per protocol. Landing site was rocky soil, down to one foot, then rock. Highly flexible grasses approximately 1m in height extended as far as the eye could see, with the occasional twisting small tree. Samples of soil, grasses, and one of the trees were collected and stored on the lander.</p>
<p>The exploratory crew of 19 (one had died in the landing; seat-belt failure) walked to the outbuildings. One was 10m in height, two 5m in height, and three further out were 3m in height. Each had a rectangular floor plan, but sloped from their peak height in the west gradually down to ground level in the east. All were completely empty, except for stray plant matter and some eight-legged insectoids, samples collected. The buildings were devoid of any signs of plumbing, with the walls completely smooth.</p>
<p>Best hypotheses at the time indicated a small farming settlement, with the largest building a barn, the two smaller being houses, and the smallest as sheds.</p>
