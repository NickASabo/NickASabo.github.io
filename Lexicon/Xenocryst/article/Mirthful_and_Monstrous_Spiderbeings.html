<h1>Mirthful and Monstrous Spiderbeings</h1>
<p>Mirthful and Monstrous Spiderbeings (M&MS) are bipedal creatures that inhabit the planet of Skaoi IV. Roughly the size of a <a href="Jekalomora.html">Jekalomora</a>'s third vestigial eye, their bodies look like smooth flattened spheres made of some brightly colored, shell-like material. From the sides of these shells protrude two thin, retractable legs, and underneath, they have small mouths marked by two relatively large fangs. While resting as a colony with their legs drawn in within their papery, cocoon-like homes, they just look like harmless, brightly colored rocks.</p>
<p>But this appearance is misleading. Though they sleep in this innocuous position, when they are disturbed, they quickly swarm the disturbance. They leap up and bludgeon the disturbance with their hard, surprisingly heavy shelled bodies, knocking it over. Then they feed on it, bouncing on it on their two legs in a manner reminiscent of the Carroll's <a href="Astro-potentio-actuator.html">Astro-potentio-actuator</a>'s spring-pistons or a child bobbing happily when given a present, which lets them dig their fangs in deep with the force of their heavy bodies hitting their food. This feeding behavior is the origin of their name, as it appears mirthful yet monstrous.</p>
<p>First contact with these M&MS was made several days after the arrival of the Carroll on Skaoi IV. An unnamed crewman stumbled into one of their cocoons and was promptly overcome by the creatures. The brave Lieutenant Commander accompanying this crewman quickly assessed the situation and courageously retreated, watching the situation in horror and fascination for a time to learn about these creatures before returning to the Carroll for supplies. This hero returned after the carnage ended and took revenge, burning the cocoon and killing the entire colony of deadly M&MS. </p>
<p>Other colonies of these creatures have since been found, but they have been left undisturbed thus far pending further research.</p>
