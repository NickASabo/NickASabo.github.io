<h1>Wiegler-Nrtan Vibration</h1>
<p>Wiegler-Nrtan Vibrations have an interesting history. While they are currently being used by the Palatial Institute to search out signs of life in the universe, that is not their intended use. WN vibrations' namesakes, Wiegler and Nrtan, were not scientists, but rather the members of one of the most popular scientific-rock bands in history, <a href="The_VViggles.html">The VViggles</a>. A few of their more die-hard groupies decided that the whole universe deserved to be able to listen to the band's music incessantly, so they created a device to send "Wiegler-Nrtan Vibrations," which mimicked the frequencies of the band's hit songs, out into the universe for all to experience.</p>
<p>Those groupies claim that the vibrations "travel as waves along the fabric of space-time itself, as there isn't much else to send vibrations through in space, now is there?" and refuse to explain what exactly they are or how they produce them. However, this method of transmitting the music means it cannot be listened to, but just felt subconsciously by everything the waves are aimed at. The first planet they aimed their signal at had only primitive forms of intelligent life, but the subconscious influence of these waves and their surprisingly educational lyrics led to a technological revolution literally overnight. Out of curiosity, the groupies strengthened the signal. It tore a hole in space-time and the planet was ripped apart and disappeared.</p>
<p>The groupies have since altered their output to cover the entire universe at once, just as they originally intended, though the signal is significantly weaker as a result. Scientists have begun to study these strange signals as if it were a natural phenomenon and found that they cause different reactive vibrations depending on the substance. As living bodies resonate a distinct way, monitoring WN vibrations has proven to be a reliable way of finding planets harboring life, as seen with <a href="The_Discovery_of_Skaoi_IV.html">Skaoi IV</a>. Strangely, <a href="Quasi-Inviolables.html">certain objects</a> do not react at all to these waves, while others like <a href="Kila.html">Kila</a>, <a href="Titanite.html">Titanite</a>, and <a href="Zoocium.html">Zoocium</a> resonate with very complementary vibrations to each other.</p>
<p>Even at their lowered intensity, WN vibrations have a beneficial impact on the universe, slightly increasing the average intelligence and sense of rhythm in living beings everywhere. And only three other planets have since been vibrated apart and swallowed by rifts in the fabric of space-time because of Wiegler-Nrtan Vibrations, so not a bad track record overall.</p>
