<h1>Jekalomora</h1>
<p><i>Journal entry #53: Today was far more of an adventure than usual. After a very unfortunate miscommunication negotiating with locals and promptly fleeing the village, we took refuge in a nearby jungle located in a mountain range on the western continent of Skaoi IV. Within an hour of hiding under the neon orange foliage and standing out like sore thumbs in our much drabber clothing, we were sniffed out by one of the strangest creatures of Skaoi that I've encountered so far. After extensive experiments and observation, I have prepared a full analysis for science. Read on if you dare.</i></p>
<p>Jekalomoras are apex predators of Skaoi IV jungles identifiable by its massive cannonball-like body and plethora of vestigial eyes. Its silver outer carapace is a tough, thick hide. It moves by rolling and will destroy anything in its path without hesitation. Jekalmora size is directly proportional to amount of prey consumed. A well-fed Jekalmora can grow indefinitely, but a starving one will shrink in size. This change occurs rapidly. The average Jekalmora is approximately the size of an elephant. When a Jekalmora shrinks to a sixth of that size, it is in danger of death or being preyed upon by other creatures. Extending from its body are at least three vestigial eyes of various sizes. The quantity and size of these eyes vary per individual, except the third vestigial eye is always about half a meter in diameter. The eyes retract into its body when it moves. None of these eyes are functionable for sight, but serves as a braking mechanism by protruding out to stop rolling or to change direction. The Jekalmora has an incomparably keen sense of smell through a hole on its surface, and that's the only sense it has.</p>
<p>Its spherical body will divide in half to reveal its mouth. The top half of the sphere levitates above the bottom half upon separation. The mouth is filled with a <a href="Kila.html">red liquid saliva</a> that has the power to levitate objects. It attacks its prey by suspending its prey mid-air, flattening the prey into a pancake, and then spitting its red saliva at it to levitate the prey into its mouth. The volume of saliva contacting the object surface compared to the total volume of the object determines distance of levitation from the ground. In large quantities, its levitation effects can affect <a href="Titanite.html">Titanite</a> nearby the source levitated body. Zyther, the God of Floating Rocks, is believed to be a deified Jekalomora. Jekalomoras, athough revered as a god, are often poached by Zytherists to collect its precious saliva to levitate their <a href="Zyther_Temple.html">Zyther temples</a>.</p>
