<h1>Dallywinged Glidosaur</h1>
<p>The Dallywinged Glidosaur is a bizarre beast. A reptilian glider, like the pterosaurs of prehistoric Earth or the Engalionaik of Closius III except about ten times bigger, the Glidosaur is the largest flying creature on the planet, even larger than the <a href="Interior_Arachnowyrms.html">Interior Arachnowyrms</a>. We first discovered them on a visit to <a href="Kraakberg.html">Kraakberg</a>, where my men were startled to see them passing overhead. After a brief standoff with police due to drawing our weapons on reflex, we were assured that the brutes were quite tame, and exceedingly useful. Docile herbivores, their enormous size allows them to carry large numbers of people or loads of cargo, and their homing behavior allows them to do so unsupervised. Some have even used them to go <a href="Ratbird_hunting.html">Ratbird hunting</a>, since they're essentially airborne harpoon platforms.</p>
<p>Unlike the Arachnowyrms, the Glidosaurs do not appear to have any titanite content- and some form of antigravity is needed for things as huge as these to even remain standing, let alone fly. Instead, they maintain large reserves of <a href="Kila.html">Kila</a> obtained from their primary food, the <a href="Yellow_Deathcatheter.html">Yellow Deathcatheter</a>. This presents the single greatest obstacle in keeping Glidosaurs, and why they are not in wider use. Deathcatheters are difficult to grow outside of the tropics, and so Glidosaurs are only kept by the rich, or corporations that can afford it.</p>
<p>Attempts to use the Glidosaurs for exploration of Skaoi IV have gone... poorly. First, there was that incident where personnel from the Carroll were taken halfway accross the planet against their will. On the side of the Ogden... well, it turns out that the bobbing motion of a Glidosaur in flight is quite a bit like a ship in rough seas, and my men have never served in a navy. Between debilitating seasickness and lack of sea legs, it looks like we're not cut out for harnessing the power of the Glidosaur for ourselves. Rest in peace, David, Felicia, and Orglak.</p>
