<h1>The Choir of the Ruins</h1>
<p>In the middle of a ruined city to the west of <a href="The_Giant_Dividing_Wall.html">The Giant Dividing Wall</a>, the crew of the Carroll made a most unexpected discovery: a species whose appearance clashed dramatically with the dreary, war torn ruins of a civilization. The first indication that they were not alone in the ruins was a hint of movement behind rubble and a faint song carried to us on the weak breeze. Bored by the archeological surveying being conducted by the rest of the crew, a certain Lieutenant Commander followed this faint sound farther into the city.</p>
<p>After a short walk, the Lieutenant Commander found something remarkable: a large gathering of small bipedal creatures who were just finishing up a song. The creatures were surprisingly adorable, with pink, round, fluffy bodies and giant blue eyes. They then noticed the intruder and swarmed, but chattered happily and showed no signs of aggression. They invited the Lieutenant Commander into their midst and began singing once again, but this song made their guest quickly fall asleep. When the Lieutenant Commander awoke, the choir was gone.</p>
<p>After stumbling back to the rest of the crew with a headache almost as bad as one experienced after spending a night drinking with <a href="Maria_Verdes.html">Professor Verdes</a>, the Lieutenant Commander was distraught to find them collapsed on the ground, covered in <a href="Kila.html">red fluid</a>. Determined to exact revenge on the creatures who did this, the Lieutenant Commander tracked them down, once again following flashes of pink and hints of a song. Upon finding the gathering again, the Lieutenant Commander eliminated all of the creatures present.</p>
<p>Returning to the fallen crew with the intent to mourn, the Lieutenant Commander was surprised to find they were all alive and well, studying the patterns drawn on their bodies by "singing cotton candy." This meant that the singing creatures were not the violent monsters they were thought to be, but there was still no regret for the deaths of the choir of the ruins, as a species that could easily lull victims into a deep sleep posed much too great a threat to leave alive. Besides â€“ there must have been survivors, for as the crew left the ruins, they heard a ghostly song drifting mournfully behind them.</p>
