<h1>Maria Verdes</h1>
<p>[Exerpt from tae manual on personnel.]</p>
<p><b>Dr. Maria Verdes</b> is a famed professor of the Ares Curiosity Institute.
Notably the first android to complete a formal higher education,
she has set many standards of excellence in physics, anthropology,
beauty, psychology, and art/manipulation.
Her contributions have recently focused on
<a href="The_Discovery_of_Skaoi_IV.html">astronomy</a>,
amazingly contributing to both the Twelfth University of Terra's
and and the Palatial Institute's methods of searching for life on other worlds,
and making headlines in <a href="Unitied_Astronomics.html">Unitied Astronomics</a>.</p>
<p><i><b>Creation.</b></i>
Maria was conceived by a team of researchers at
College Freyja for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence
who believed they were creating merely the next advancement
in android research. Though initial measurements indicated
the same mental acuity as other androids at the time,
it was clear from the start that they had topped the scales
in je ne sais quoi,
as few researchers were not immediately smitten by her beauty and eloquence,
and a subteam had to be carefully selected to
continue the study while avoiding sexual harassment charges.</p>
<p><i><b>Childhood.</b></i> 
As it happened, the researchers unintentionally broke the <i>third boundary</i>
and managed to successfully manufacture an appropriate childhood procedure.
The breakthrough involved creating the most complete simulation ever made,
one that could seamlessly transition from basic world elements into
the complete physical reality we find ourselves chained to as humans.</p>
<p>[Incidentally, creating a means to recreate one's childhood in
this better-imagined world resulted in the most successful MMORPG ever made,
as demand had never been higher,
but that result of the research came later.]</p>
<p>It's clear that Maria holds tightly to her childhood memories,
as she still uses the same handle, GreenNight,
and has been <a href="Untitled.html">quoted</a> to say "it was probably honestly better
than being raised on a ship."</p>
<p><i><b>Adulthood.</b></i>
[currently in progress...]</p>
<p><i><b>Conclusions.</b></i>
Despite thousands of years of fear and disgust around the androids
and artificial intelligence, (see <i>uncanny valley</i>)
it seems that a simulated human experience can be more human in the end.
Additionally, we may conclude that on the other side of the valley
is not something that merely feels human in appearance,
but superhuman, as so many have fallen for the beautiful professor
in her few years in existence that her name has finally replaced
Kevin Bacon in the classic parlor game "Sixteen Degrees of Separation",
lowering the number to a mere "Five Degrees of Flirtation"
required before connecting anyone to her.</p>
