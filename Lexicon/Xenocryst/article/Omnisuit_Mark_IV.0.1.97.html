<h1>Omnisuit Mark IV.0.1.97</h1>
<p>All right soldier, so you've been assigned to the Ogden, with its legendary reputation as the field testing vessel for various prominent defense contractors. Yeah, that's the reason why our shirts are red, our pants are brown, and our per-EVA casualty rate is in the double-digits. But this beauty right here, this is what I think might just push it down to 9%. The Omnisuit Mark IV, ultimate survival system.</p>
<p>Completely self-contained, this suit will handle anything from vacuum to 20 atmospheres of external pressure. Stores rations for a week. Full water and waste recycling (and venting as needed). Light sources. Strength enhancement. Acid resistant, base resistant, flame retardant, thermal regulation covering any conditions you're likely to walk into, except an actively burning star (RIP Matt). Its explodium power source will outlive you, and the <a href="Linfroggles.html">linfroggles</a>. Oh, the linfroggles. You can twiddle them quite nearly to your heart's content, and I hear the brains have finally figured out all the lethal bugs, like the one that fried poor Roy when he caused the environment sensors to invert. Or the one that got Jane when the artificial gravity activated in the wrong direction while on-planet. Or... ahem. Nevermind. All the bugs, definitely fixed, and the legendarily incomprehensible linfroggle twiddle/detwid system has been made completely intuitive and will definitely not accidentally result in administrator override of various critical support systems in starships that may or may not even be associated with our organization(s).</p>
<p>Now, while the Omnisuit you have just been given is excellent already, the brains are always looking to improve them. When we're exploring the <a href="Ruined_Zones.html">Ruined Zones</a>, be on the lookout for <a href="Quasi-Inviolables.html">Quasi-Inviolables</a>. You should recognize them by their simple geometries and the way they seem to suck in the light around them. Their alleged indestructibility should have some obvious implications for use as armor, especially given the Omnisuit's current... semi-permeable state against hand-held low-caliber projectile weapons.</p>
