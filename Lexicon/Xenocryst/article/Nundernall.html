<h1>Nundernall</h1>
<p><i>Journal entry #71: Today I dropped into the interior of Skaoi IV for the first time to begin a two week-study of its biomes. My first set of field logs of this area is listed below. I ran into -  more so smacked into by - an orbiting fellow Carroll Crewmen Tyne Dyer and Co. and delivered them a week's worth of food (I had originally planned a three week study). They got really mad at me for not bringing rope though. How was I supposed to know? :( I gave them a ball of yarn out of spite. I guess I won't be crocheting that plushie jekalomora hacky sack during downtime. Anyway, here's Nundernall.</i></p>
<p>0400 CST (Carroll standard time) - Dropped down into the interior of Skaoi IV using a <a href="Titanite.html">Titanite</a> travel pod from The Carroll from a hole that we tunnelled beneath our ship using a drill adapter that we borrowed from The Ogden.</p>
<p>0415 CST - Realized I forgot my toothbrush and requested a return pull.</p>
<p>0515 CST - Returned to the interior of Skaoi IV. Looking out of the window of my pod, I noticed:</p>
<p>Chunks of dirt and debris falling into what appears to be a black hole. The debris seems to come from the...</p>
<p>Orbiting islands shining with Titanite alloys. From my position in orbit around the black hole, there are at least thirty orbiting islands of various sizes, with the side containing biomes facing away from the black hole.</p>
<p>As black dirt flew towards the black hole, the island drifted closer to the black hole. Grey dirt loss did not impact island position.</p>
<p>0700 CST - My pod shook hard. It appears that a swarm of <a href="Interior_Arachnowyrms.html">hungry little creatures</a> thought my pod was a shiny snack!</p>
<p>0710 CST - Request for assistance from The Carroll granted. LCdr Olivum activated the pulse foximiter on my pod and ultimately shined the poor creature to death. Smashing.</p>
<p>0900 CST - Woke up from my nap after a rather exciting morning after I hear my pod doorbell ring. It is Dyer and his posse.</p>
<p>0930 CST - Bade farewell to Dyer. I managed to collect some of the dirt hurling towards the hole while the port was open.</p>
<p>1200 CST - After doing a full chemical analysis using my pocket HPSLGC kit, I have identified a few notable characteristics:</p>
<p>The <a href="Zoocium.html">dirt chunk</a> is vantablack and seems to absorb light from around it (my bench was notably dimmer).</p>
<p>I combined the dirt and titanite and it became a dull, normal grey rock. I tossed it out the port and it it hovered, not orbiting.</p>
<p>1400 CST - Upon observation of the interior shell of Nundernall, it seems that the inner surface is coated with a familiar though slightly different red liquid.</p>
