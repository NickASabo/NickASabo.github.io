<h1>The Giant Dividing Wall</h1>
<p>As I'm sure you're aware, Director, the crust of Skaoi IV is much thinner in many places than one would expect. Normally this would be rectified quickly by gravity, especially with a black hole in place of a core, but the <a href="Ellow_Cable.html">cabling</a> and <a href="Zoocium.html">mineral features</a> of the crust somehow keep it from collapsing, even when weighed down by superstructures such as the <b>Giant Dividing Wall</b>. Some of these structures are so massive that they go all the way through the planet's shell-like exterior, creating opportunities to study e.g. the wide base of the Wall that protrudes from the inner surface. Since the other researchers have submitted <a href="Cytorius_Gate.html">adequate reports</a> on the features of its thinner, surface-accessible top, I humbly submit the first ever <i>sub</i>surface report on the Giant Dividing Wall:</p>
<p>It has legs. The blasted thing has <i>legs</i>. Hundreds of them, along its entire length.</p>
<p>Was it built as a weapon of planetary defense, like the <a href="Nundernall.html">Nundernall</a>? But then why would it be buried? Perhaps it was itself a threat, and the Skaoians buried it here to imprison it. But populated biomes orbit within kicking range of its long legs. If it were a threat, surely they would be more wary.</p>
<p>Anyway I'm sure it's nothing to worry about and you don't have to <a href="Skaoi_IV.html">report</a> anything. I'll play you some mood music on your next date or something, when we get out of this orbit. Never mind the Mimeese below, it's my scratch for the choreography, ha ha.</p>

<p><i>[MachineDirective:TranscriptionIgnore] &lt;Translated from Mimeese&gt; Of course, it isn't either of those. Neither explanation is sufficient. The sheer amount of cabling in it couldn't have been put</i> in <i>when they buried it. More likely, the cabling came</i> out. <i>Does Skaoi IV</i> look <i>like a planet with the resources to make that much Ellow cable? Sure, there's a lot of titanite here, but</i> that much? <i>And where are the factories that produced it? Meanwhile, there's enough room in the buried body of the Wall to fit factories and cable enough for the planet.</i></p>
<p><i>Under pretense of needing material for a heroic epic, I got the files on <a href="The_Discovery_of_Skaoi_IV.html">the 4787 Goldilocks Survey</a> from <a href="6c679d25.html">Sinclair</a>. He must be either bureaucracy-deficient or a rogue actor, because they were the</i> unredacted <i>versions. Turns out the Director's hiding more than just Mimestry bills. Skaoi IV was thoroughly surveyed in 4319, and the results are what ended up in the Ellow network. But a lot was redacted, including seismic scans. The planet wasn't hollow 400 years ago. Something</i> happened.</p>
<p><i>The <a href="Voidsenders.html">Voidsenders</a> in the "black hole". The ruins in <a href="The_Kelornac_Expanse.html">the Kelornac Expanse</a>. Why the Ellow records were <a href="Terminal_Prime.html">tampered with</a> and why they stop 400 years ago. It all fits together, and the Giant Dividing Wall is the key:</i> This isn't Skaoi IV. The real Skaoi IV is gone, and has been for 400 years. <i>The planet we've been exploring is an imitation, built by the Wall or its masters around its Ellow cable mesh, according to the records from when the planet was last seen in 4319, in order to hide what's going on inside from prying eyes. I don't know yet who the powers at play are, and my access to information here in subsurface orbit is limited, but I can already tell this goes all the way up.</i></p>
<p><i>We're so close to the truth, Computer. Keep troubling the Director as far as you can, without raising suspicion. Relay this report to our contacts within <a href="The_Obvious.html">the </i>Obvious<i></a>.</i></p>
