<h1>Oq'r'a'astaki</h1>
<p>Oq'r'a'astaki is the official language of the Confederated Democracy of Systems and is the primary language spoken by the citizens of Oq'r'a'a'aa'', the capital planet of the CDS. It is one of, if not <i>the</i> most beautiful language in existence, utilizing phonemes not found in any other languages (including the exceedingly magnificent velar trill and glottal nasal). The elegance of the Oq'r'a'astaki language stems from its ability to be spoken both in water and on land, which of course is crucial in the language development of young Oq'r'a'a'aa''ans. </p>
<p><b>History and Significance</b><br>
In <a href="The_War_of_Whimsy.html">The War of Whimsy</a>, both sides intercepted each other's messages using patented <a href="Wiegler-Nrtan_Vibration.html">WN</a> technologies, but CDS translators were more successful in interpreting enemy codes due to their naturally superior linguistic abilities. This pushed the war in favor of the CDS, but the Democratic Ianthine Caconymic King got bored and cooperated to end the war. </p>
<p>After the Shenanigan Treaty of 4086 was signed, Oq'r'a'astaki/English lessons became an important part of the <a href="H.I.T.L.E.R._Program.html">H.I.T.L.E.R. Program</a> so that graduates from the <a href="Confederated_Democracy_of_Systems_Royal_University.html">CDS-RU</a> could easily work together with their colleagues from the FRP. Generally, due to the outstanding simplicity of the English language and the overall ability of each people to learn languages, English is the primary language used in cooperations between the two regimes (although there are some Jester-Sages who believe that the CDS should not work with those from the FRP if they cannot speak Oq'r'a'astaki). </p>
<p>The Oq'r'a'astaki language has had a significant role in the CDS's relations with the Galactic Jape. It is the official view of the CDS that Oq'r'a'astaki is the original "proto-language" from which all other languages in this galaxy came, and is thus also the language of choice of the gods Examince, Zettamince, and Yottamince. The appropriation of these gods and <a href="The_Final_Hoodwink.html">The Final Hoodwink</a> by the Galactic Jape is an incredibly insulting blasphemy which has resulted in eternal war against them. </p>
