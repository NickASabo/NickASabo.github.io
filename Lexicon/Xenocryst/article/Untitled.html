<h1>Untitled</h1>
<p><i><b>Classification error has occurred. Please restart your system.</b></i></p>
<p><b>Untitled</b> is a series of poems found on the surface of <a href="Skaoi_IV.html">Skaoi IV</a>, seemingly written by many, many authors over the last few hundred million years, coming from many, many different species. Initially thought to be separate texts, we now presume these works to comprise a larger collection or continuous epic.</p>
<p>A part of Untitled was first found in a bundle of firewood and kindling in a settlement in the Unwasteland, by the Redshirt platoon. It is speculated, by radioactive dating and the local's "biology", that these were remnants of some civilization prior to the current residents. The subject became a popular meme among the group, who joked that it was a communication from Montglimmery Scott's species (The joke being that Montglimmery Scott isn't a human, because he speaks in poetic form only. He is, in reality, of course, human. Who told you otherwise? What are their addresses?). On record, Montglimmery insists he speaks "ordinar", only when he's "blootered" is he a "makar". This fragment reads:</p>
<p>Untitled</p>
<p>And outtrage awenture of men blacche-whit,<br>
If he wyl lysten this laye bot on littel quile,<br>
I schal telle hit as-tit, as I in slumber herde,<br>
<a href="The_War_of_Whimsy.html">The wor ferther than worlde,</a><br>
Of wyche and worlock, smylyng and smote.</p>
<p>The spread and species of these fragment's creation was a matter of much debate early after more fragments resurfaced in <a href="Downtown_Skaoi.html">strange</a> <a href="Yttrois.html">corners</a> <a href="Ruined_Zones.html">of the world</a>. The media was varied from carvings to <a href="Kalbion.html">game text-logs</a>, with no apparent link except in their style and content. Finally, in a lucky coincidence, one Redshirt, whose <a href="Omnisuit_Mark_IV.0.1.97.html">suit's</a> auto-translator was malfunctioning noticed that he could read it fine (well, as well as anyone could) without the help of this suit.</p>

<p>Further examination with CDS interns proved that this was in an old relic of modern FRP-Standard. This discovery quickly recontextualized the search for these Untitled fragments, and despite some <a href="The_Diaries_of_Hog.html">bad poetry and red herrings</a>, many useful fragments are now actively being studied. It should be noted that althought it may look like the poems are not titled, they are. This fragment appears to contain the titular line:</p>
<p>Untitled</p>

<p><b><a href="Maria_Verdes.html">GreenNight</a></b>: And that's how you know if you're living in a simulation.<br>
<b>Khanman</b>: Wow, your <i>whole</i> childhood?<br>
<b>GreenNight</b>: Yeah, it was probably honestly better than being raised on a ship. I've heard tough things about the Little Tots Military Academy for Gifted Youth. Like, heard that there are basically gangs in there, with these crazy protection schemes and shakedowns. Makes me shudder.<br>
<b>Khanman</b>: Eh, it's pretty easy. All you need to do hyperinflate the gum economy, get the muscle that can be easily bought, then you get working on the strong-willed ones.<br>
<b>Khanman</b>: Report all the drug dealers you see, then get a cut and start dealing from inside, use that money to buy the teachers.<br>
<b>Khanman</b>:  <i>That's</i> when you get the strong-willed ones.<br>
<b>Khanman</b>: So really avoiding gang trouble and bullying is pretty easy once you get right down to it.<br>
<b>GreenNight</b>: ...<br>
<b>Khanman</b>: Oh oh have you seen this picture of my kitty Kehsok?<br>
&lt;Image not found&gt;<br>
<b>GreenNight</b>: No?<br>
<b>Khanmman</b>: Well he doesn't show up very well in pictures.<br>
<b>GreenNight</b>: No i literally can't see it lmaocopter<br>
<b>Khanman</b>: Oh well, he must've corrupted the camera again. He literally doesn't show up well in pictures.</p>
