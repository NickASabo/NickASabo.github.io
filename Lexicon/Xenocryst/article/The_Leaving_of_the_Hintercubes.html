<h1>The Leaving of the Hintercubes</h1>
<p>No one really knows the origin or age of the gigantic hintercubes sitting atop the tall spires of the <a href="Golgian_Mountain_Range.html">Golgian Mountain Range</a>. Balanced precariously on top of the peaks, the hintercubes are the topic of many theories about the history of Skaoi IV. A few theories claim that they are natural formations, though most seem to think they are some sort of alien spaceship. Some of these credit them with bringing the earliest forms of life to Skaoi IV; others credit them with bringing some sort of <a href="Invasive_Species.html">Invasive Species</a> that could have caused all of the destruction seen around the planet. </p>
<p>One of these theories claims that these hintercubes are what brought the <a href="Voidsenders.html">Voidsenders</a> to Skaoi IV. The Voidsenders landed in the Golgian Mountain Range in these cubes, bringing advanced technologies and helping create the lifestyles and culture that was recorded in the <a href="Ellow_Cable.html">Ellow Cable</a> network across the planet. </p>
<p>But at some point something must have gone wrong. It was theorized within this theory that as the Voidsenders spent more and more time away from their hintercubes, their forms and motives began to change. When they left their hintercubes for good – possibly because they felt they were no longer needed, or maybe they lost their keys and got locked out – they became the monsters they are now, and used their technologies to reform Skaoi IV to suit their new forms just as they had shaped it to fit their original ones.  </p>
<p>But this is all just some strange theory to explain random giant blocks on top of mountains. We could sooner agree on the intelligence of various Skaoian species than we could prove that the Voidsenders are and have ever been anything more than creeps who live in a <a href="The_biggest_blackest_hole.html">black hole</a>.</p>
