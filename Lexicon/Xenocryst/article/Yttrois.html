<h1>Yttrois</h1>
<p><i>I have prepared the following report based on the unofficial and unsubmitted notes by Dr. Rosalie F. Wyndenhart, a passenger aboard the Carroll, on the orders of Kelsey Khan, Director of Travels and Communications, The Ashbery, Federated Republic of Planets. Though she was the primary explorer of Yttrois among either of our crews, Wyndenhart was unavailable to prepare the report herself due to her detention upon bringing an <a href="Invasive_Species.html">Invasive Species</a> aboard the Ashbery, in clear violation of F.R.P. law.</i></p>
<p>Yttrois is a city-state located in the Kelornac Expanse and inhabited mostly by <a href="The_Amazing_Aakkchut.html">humanoids</a>. Yttrois is a local political powerhouse, leveraging its unparalleled agriculture and stability to bring most surrounding settlements under its umbrella. Its unusually high agricultural output is achieved due to being built in the center of the <a href="Ghallas_Scat-droppings.html">Ghallas ratbird</a> mating grounds, providing an excellent fertilizer and defense against the seasonal acid rain.</p>
<p>The stability of Yttrois must be considered in the context of the regular disasters that befall Skaoi IV due to its location on a world-worm migration route. Most permanent settlements risk total destruction regularly, with entire populations vanishing practically overnight. Yttrois is not exempt to physical destruction. The city itself is constructed mostly of mud and the thick sod of the Expanse, which is then covered in scat-droppings as both a binding agent and to defend against the acid rain in the spring. While this does not the most stable of buildings, the denizens of Yttrois recognize that long-term building is a fool's game on Skaoi IV. This construction method means reconstruction is easy in the fairly regular event of the city's total annihilation. However, in contrast to most other settlements, the population suffers very few casualties in these tragedies due to Yttrois maintaining an island in <a href="Downtown_Skaoi.html">The Interior</a> capable of fitting its entire population. The island, also known as Yttrois, is kept directly beneath the city between world-worm attacks via careful management of its <a href="Titanite.html">Titanite</a> and <a href="Zoocium.html">Zoocium</a> content, with supplies of both kept in the city's evacuation points to offset the sudden weight increase in the event of total population displacement. During one of these attacks, the ancient (for Skaoi, anyway) clan of Islandmasters assume absolute authority on the island. Even though conservation of angular momentum is slightly broken around the black hole, the Islandmasters are highly capable in the skill of piloting the island around to keep the black hole between it and any attacking world-worm. Of course, this is made easier by the use of <a href="Nundernall.html">warships</a> to provoke the worms and herd them away from the island. This last point, their control of most of the great warships of Skaoi IV and hence where on the planet the worms will cause the greatest devastation, is perhaps Yttrois' greatest political leverage on the global stage, or what remains of one in the current era anyway.</p>
