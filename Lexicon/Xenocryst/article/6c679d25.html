<h1>Percival "Maverick" Sinclair, Scientist-Adventurer Extraordinaire</h1>
<p><i>The following is a eulogy for Dr. Percival "Maverick" Sinclair, delivered by Lieutenant Redshirt during Dr. Sinclair's premature funeral, since retracted due to his unexpected return. It is retained for archival reasons.</i></p>
<p>Maverick was a man close to many of our hearts, and mine especially: he was the only brass I ever truly loved. He had many roles: scientist, adventurer, scientist-adventurer, and friend. Extraordinary in every way, he led us through many a challenge, never fearing to take charge when the going got tough. He looked out for everyone around him, even and especially my boys, and I know all of us here owe our lives to him <a href="The_Crunching.html">at least once</a>.</p>
<p>Maverick started his illustrious career as the apprentice of renowned xenoarchaeologist Delaware Smith, after responding to a distress signal from Dr. Smith received on his self-designed subspace communicator- always with the gadgets, even from an early age, eh? After learning the tricks of the xenoarchaeological trade from Smith, Maverick made his way through the PhD program at the CDS Royal University at record speed.</p>
<p>After this, he bravely joined the Ogden, and has been with us ever since. I won't recount his many, many escapades here, since there'll be enough of that at the bar afterwards. No, Maverick's greatest adventure was unfortunately his last. When Tyne and the others fell into <a href="Downtown_Skaoi.html">The Interior</a>, Maverick immediately put together an expedition to make a more controlled descent through the <a href="Zyther_Temple.html">Zyther Temple</a> to recover them. We are all dismayed that the properties and workings of <a href="Titanite.html">titanite</a> were not well understood at the time, and that a certain <a href="Quasi-Inviolables.html">subtle interaction</a>, which none of us could have foreseen, led to his untimely demise. Rest in peace old friend. But I can't find it in me to give up on you just yet. If there's any man who could defy the fabric of space-time itself and find his way out of a black hole, it would be you.</p>
