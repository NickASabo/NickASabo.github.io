<h1>The Final Hoodwink</h1>
<p>Oh, The Final Hoodwink. It will destroy the universe as we know it, civilization being devoured very literally by the terrible Clown-God Yottamince. She will awaken and hunt down every form of life in the universe just like an <a href="Interior_Arachnowyrms.html">Interior Arachnowyrm</a> hunting ratbirds. Except we won't put up anywhere near as much of a fight. And she is known as She Who Masticates the Universe for good reason - for once she has caught us and we are at her mercy, she will disrupt the world as we know it, chewing it up and spitting it out, leaving a few survivors to try to make something of the chewed up universe before she chews it up again. It will be an endless cycle of suffering, sorrow, and annoying chewing sounds, and even <a href="The_VViggles.html">The VViggles</a> in all their vvisdom won't be able to tell us how to get out of it. </p>
<p>Or rather, it would be like that. But you see, we have learned that Yottamince is currently resting within the core of the Galactic Jape's home planet, drawing strength and nutrients from the worship and evil tomfoolery of her clown-clerics while her appetite grows. So the logical decision when seeking to save the universe itself is to destroy the Galactic Jape before Yottamince grows strong enough to destroy everything. There are several plans being outlined to accomplish this, the least complicated of which involves towing the Galactic Jape's home planet into <a href="The_biggest_blackest_hole.html">the biggest blackest hole</a> (or a closer, though possibly smaller and paler, hole) by hitching it to a few world-worms. The destruction of a planet and entire not-civilization could perhaps be seen as extreme, but in the face of what would practically be the end of the universe, it is easily excusable. </p>
