<h1>Kila</h1>
<p><b>Kila</b> describes a red liquid which purportedly induces levitation on the planet of Skaoi IV. Produced by the adult forms of froglike, spherical creatures known as <a href="Jekalomora.html">Jekalomora</a>, this fluid somehow evolved or was designed as a means of predation, despite a highly complex, seemingly inorganic molecular structure. While the fluid itself doesn't levitate, it behaves similarly to a Newtonian fluid, acting as a solid under certain circumstances, such as the application of pressure above a certain threshhold. It will, however, melt and seemingly vanish entirely into certain solid materials, such as <a href="Titanite.html">Titanite</a>, infusing the material with its levitative properties. Offworld attempts to reconstruct this sequence have failed. Onworld attempts have enjoyed mixed success, producing unstable, unremarkable gases. This molecular structure is of secondary note, however, to the dimensional harmonics of the liquid, in particular its <a href="Wiegler-Nrtan_Vibration.html">WN-range</a>. </p>
<p>The boffins have put forward several theories as to why such a strange fluid is possible. If I'm reading these reports correctly, the prevailing theories center around the black hole at the center of the planet, Titanite, or God. This one here, by the lovely, intelligent, pretty, resourceful, beautiful <a href="Maria_Verdes.html">Profesor Verdes</a>, is at least enjoyable to read:</p>
<p><i>Kila, Titanite, the black hole, and the strange dimensional harmonics surrounding all of these bear some sort of multichicken-egg relationship. Did exposure to the black hole create titanite, which enables the Kila? Or did Titanite and Kila somehow induce or create this phenomenon? Some primary and quaternary experimentations suggest that objects levitated by Kila don't defy gravity, they ignore, specifically, the black hole's gravity. Is this substance context-based, only present here because it can only exist here? For my money, there's something bigglier at play in the WN around this place. Something smartlier than any of the species we've encountered thus far. How did the Kila get here? Who, or what, could've created such an ingenious material? Did the substance naturally evolve in the Jekalmora? What relation have they to the <a href="Quasi-Inviolables.html">Quasi-Inviolables</a>? Maybe the whole planet's full of the stuff, and that's what keeps the surface from falling below...</i></p>
<p>Wow. Sounds like the kind of smart, cosmopolitan lady who should hang around The Ashbery's First Level bar from 2200~2400 and catch up with the officers of this fine vessel. Like where I am right now ;) ;) ;) how'd u like to meet a genetically perfect specimen ;)))))) i won best in show at no less than 24 comptitions during my childhoodisn't that right Compy? Me and Mr Computer are getting along great. I wonder if he has kids</p>
