<h1>Quasi-Inviolables</h1>
<p>As the Director of Occasional Music and Head Mime of the Wordless Portable Orchestra Corps of the <i>Carroll</i>, it is my duty to manage not only the placement and music selection of the PorOrCorps, but also to represent <a href="Degenerative_Mime_Disease.html">the interests and needs of its members</a> -- a necessary duty given the vow of silence we take as sacred mimes. One of my first tasks upon any embarkment is to secure a supply line of materials that can be used to repair our elaborate personal multi-instrument setups, so that we are always ready to play ominous music anywhere and anytime.</p>
<p>Initial excavations have turned up a number of objects that have been termed <b>quasi-inviolables</b>. Though they appear to be utterly structurally immutable, the researchers think that the former inhabitants of these ruins must have been able to shape them somehow, so there must be <i>some</i> way to affect them. Microscopic analysis has given no insight, as they appear to be entirely solid even at the atomic scale. Simple geometries make up the bulk of the quasi-inviolables found so far, with discoid, cuboid, and cylindroid being the most common genera. However, some rarer geometries were also found, such as spheroids, asters, and mysterious humming.</p>
<p>It was suggested to me by <a href="6c679d25.html">Dr. Sinclair</a>
that if we could find a way to shape it, quasi-inviolable material would be excellent for our instruments, because they would be unbreakable. What rubbish! Instruments need material that can vibrate in order to produce the proper tenor, and the quasi-inviolables don't have the give for it. I recommend that they be disposed of, as they clearly have no use whatsoever.</p>
