<h1>Confederated Democracy of Systems Royal University</h1>
<p><i>Journal entry #151: Today, I received a hurried videologram from my sponsor, Lord Rimwich. He informed me that I was to deposit any live or perishable specimens to the CDS-RU as soon as possible, as he will be visiting there within the next few weeks for a conference. I myself have never visited there, as I am a proud alumnus of The University at Terra, so I did some additional research to familiarize myself before my visit. Intern Keith, a member of their <a href="H.I.T.L.E.R._Program.html">H.I.T.L.E.R. Program</a>, was gracious enough to let me interview him for a few hours. Read on.</i></p>
<p>The Confederated Democracy of Systems Royal University, commonly known as Royal University, is a public research university located on a 3000-acre campus in Houskilogram, Terxes, Oq'r'a'a'aa'', United Confederated Democracy of Systems. The university is situated near the Houskilogram Museum District and is adjacent to the Terxes Medical Center. Royal is generally considered the most selective institution of higher education in the subsystem of Terxes.</p>
<p>Opened in 2912 after the murder of its namesake W'l'aq'a'a'm m'a'a"ar"sh Royal (his father was Terran), Royal is now a research university with an undergraduate focus. Its emphasis on education is demonstrated by an enormous student body and a 6:1 student-<a href="Maria_Verdes.html">faculty</a> ratio, and it has been universally recognized as a leading university for undergraduate teaching. The university has a very high level of research activity for its size, with 140.2 billion credits in sponsored research funding in 3016. Royal is noted for its applied science programs in the fields of artificial <a href="Linfroggles.html">linfroggle</a> research, structural <a href="Quasi-Inviolables.html">Quasi-Inviolables</a> analysis, <a href="Astro-potentio-actuator.html">Astro-potentio-actuator</a> processing, space science, and <a href="Nanobots.html">Nanobots</a>. It was ranked first in the world in <a href="Titanite.html">materials science</a> research by the CDS Higher Education (CHE) in 3010. Royal is a member of the Association of UCDS Universities.</p>
