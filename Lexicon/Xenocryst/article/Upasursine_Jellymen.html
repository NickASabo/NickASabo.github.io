<h1>Upasursine Jellymen</h1>
<p>A colony of these Upasursine Jellymen were among the many forms of intelligent life that we made contact with upon Skaoi IV. Distinct from the denizens of <a href="Yttrois.html">Yttrois</a>, who are comparatively much more humanlike, these Jellymen are made of an extremely viscous, translucent material the same color - and, it turns out, largely the same composition - as the acid rain that drops down from the inner surface. They generally hold a bulky, quadrupedal form that loosely resembles one of Earth's bears and move in a way similar to one as well, though they occasionally enjoy turning into puddles and dripping off the side of their island, swinging to reach the dripping acid rain that for some reason misses the surface of their island. This made conversations with them quite strange.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, these beings were extremely easy to communicate with, picking up on our language after only a few sentences. They "speak" with vibrations throughout their gelatinous bodies that sound near identical to a person speaking around a cup of water. Our conversations told us much about their society, so we learned that despite their intelligence, they lived very basic lives in Skaoi IV's interior, safe from being eaten by the <a href="Interior_Arachnowyrms.html">Interior Arachnowyrms</a> by their gelatinous bodies, but lacking means to improve their lives because of their isolated island's limited resources.</p>
<p>We offered them the chance to come with us to explore the areas around <a href="The_Kelornac_Expanse.html">The Kelornac Expanse</a>, and they gladly accepted, the whole colony joining us. But what we - and they - failed to notice was that as time passed, they shrank, the moisture in their bodies evaporating. By the time we realized this, we were too far from the interior's acid to replenish them, and no other substance worked. And so our greatest friends shrank away. In our ignorance and attempted generosity, we killed all of them.</p>
